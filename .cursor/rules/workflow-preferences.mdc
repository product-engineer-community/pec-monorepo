## ðŸ”„ Workflow Preferences â€“ "Work This Way"

### Default Flow

1. **Planning First** â€“ For major work, create a `plan.md` and await approval.
2. **Iterate in Steps** â€“ Break down tasks and log them in `progress.md`.
3. **Approval Required** â€“ For major changes, pause and wait for confirmation.

### File Tracking Convention

| File               | Purpose           |
| ------------------ | ----------------- |
| `docs/plan.md`     | Pre-work planning |
| `docs/progress.md` | Work logs         |
